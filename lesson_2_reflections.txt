What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
branches are useful when you want to make experimental changes. So, you can create a new branch and make all the changes in the new branch . These changes may or may not break the code. So, the master branch is always production ready , i.e., it always works and can be shared publicly. see the interview of Mike wales  in Github course on udacity.
